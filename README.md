# Simple Storage Hardhat Project

This project comes with a Simple Storage contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn install
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

**Here is the Goerli Etherscan Contract Address** [SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x14Af809Eaa7B4Fd9bD4946B9DB71eCF67E4c09D6)
```shell
0x14Af809Eaa7B4Fd9bD4946B9DB71eCF67E4c09D6
```

**Also Verified the Smart Contract using the same Hardhat Code** [VERIFIED CODE LINK](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x14Af809Eaa7B4Fd9bD4946B9DB71eCF67E4c09D6#code)


## Added TypeScript code in ts-code branch

- **You can create custom smart contract types using the following command**

 ```shell
yarn install
yarh harhdat typechain
```
- **That's it you can run the typescript code after that command**
